	    <h2> Our project was to figure out where a rover was based on the data given to us. The data collected was sound, light, temperature, and gyroscope. We were given five options, rocky mountains, desert plains, marsh lands, tropical islands, and inland forests. We ended up chosing marsh lands over inland forests because of the constant critter sounds we thought fit the data more than the constant howl of the wind with occasional thunderstorms. The two shared almost all the same characteristics besides those which helped us make our conclusion.</h2>
